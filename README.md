# mailcow-scripts

A few scripts to help manage your mailcow-dockerized installation.  I'll be adding to this repo as I find more common administrative tasks that can be easily scripted and automated.

## scripts

### mail_cleanup.sh

Delete messages in the *Junk* and *Trash* folders that are older than a certain amount of days.  Usage details in the [wiki here](https://git.asifbacchus.app/asif/mailcow-scripts/wiki/1.-mail_cleanup.sh)

### mail_prune.sh

Delete messages from all mailboxes that are older than a certain number of days, provided those messages are *READ* and *UNflagged*.  Usage details in the [wiki here](https://git.asifbacchus.app/asif/mailcow-scripts/wiki/2.-mail_prune.sh).

That's all for now!
